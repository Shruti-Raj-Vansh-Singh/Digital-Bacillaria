### Introduction  
In the study of organismal behavior from across the tree of life, there are traditionally two types of explanatory mechanism. The first is behavior that is generated by neuronal processes (such as a network of neurons), and is restricted to organisms with a nervous system. The second is behavior that is characterized by loosely-relevant physical, mechanical, and social metaphors and generated by biophysical processes. Yet recently, a new explanatory framework has emerged: non-neural cognition [1-3]. This framework ascribes information processing and decision-making capabilities to systems that lack a formal nervous system structure. Rather, the information processing function occurs in the biophysical substrate itself.  

While the diatom _Bacillaria_ does not have a nervous system, it does exhibit organized behaviors and collective movement. _Bacillaria_ consists of a series of filaments arrayed in parallel, and the behaviors exhibited across these filaments are temporally linked in a way that results in coordinated movement. Therefore, we propose that rather than using the multitude of existing metaphors to interpret _Bacillaria_ movement [4], a model of cognition can be used instead. This model of cognition results in the production of behaviors related to phototaxis [5] and psychophysics [6], which can be distinguished from random behavior using a series of criteria.   

__Hypothesis 1:__ movement of the _Bacillaria_ colony is driven by information processing, which is neuronal in scope. 

__Hypothesis 2:__ can we distinguish between real neuronal behavior and neuronal behavior not produced by a brain?  

### Models of Movement
Evaluate a series of models that explain movement (pick from the 20 or so models that Dick presented from his new paper).  

physical models, molecular models, functional models (review several different models and their plausibility).

All act as a driver of behavior: movement through the water column. Consists of individual filament behaviors and collective behaviors consisting of coordinated filament movements.  

### Neuronal regulation

__Hypothesis 1:__

Hebbian learning (elements that wire together, fire together).

each filament in the colony exhibits sliding motion. This sliding motion is coupled by neighboring filaments. 

results in a rhythmic oscillation that occurs at multiple timescales (similar to a central pattern generator).

Entrainment over time (synchronization of filaments).

__Hypothesis 2:__

some seemingly neuronal behavior is generated by muscle fibers and electrical activity. 

develop a Turing test for distinguishing neuronal-generated from non-neuronal-generated behavior.

specifically, neuronal behavior from non-neuronal systems. Similar in principle to the dilemma of fake vs. real life-like behavior.

Examples: Fake Life Recognition Contest (Alife 2019), Simulated vs. real movement in Geppetto vs. _C. elegans_.
