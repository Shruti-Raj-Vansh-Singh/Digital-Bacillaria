### Introduction  
In the study of organismal behavior from across the tree of life, there are traditionally two types of explanatory mechanism. The first is behavior that is generated by neuronal processes (such as a network of neurons), and is restricted to organisms with a nervous system. The second is behavior that is characterized by loosely-relevant physical, mechanical, and social metaphors and generated by biophysical processes. Yet recently, a new explanatory framework has emerged: non-neural cognition [1-3]. This framework ascribes information processing and decision-making capabilities to systems that lack a formal nervous system structure. Rather, the information processing function occurs in the biophysical substrate itself.  

While the diatom _Bacillaria_ does not have a nervous system, it does exhibit organized behaviors and collective movement. _Bacillaria_ consists of a series of filaments arrayed in parallel, and the behaviors exhibited across these filaments are temporally linked in a way that results in coordinated movement. Therefore, we propose that rather than using the multitude of existing metaphors to interpret _Bacillaria_ movement [4], a model of cognition can be used instead. This model of cognition results in the production of behaviors related to phototaxis [5] and psychophysics [6], which can be distinguished from random behavior using a series of criteria.   

__Hypothesis 1:__ movement of the _Bacillaria_ colony is driven by information processing, which is neuronal in scope. 

__Hypothesis 2:__ can we distinguish between real neuronal behavior and neuronal behavior not produced by a brain?  

### Models of Movement
Evaluate a series of models that explain movement (pick from the 20 or so models that Dick presented from his new paper).  

physical models, molecular models, functional models (review several different models and their plausibility).

All act as a driver of behavior: movement through the water column. Consists of individual filament behaviors and collective behaviors consisting of coordinated filament movements.  

### Neuronal regulation

__Hypothesis 1:__
To address Hypothesis #1, we will employ a version of Hebbian learning where the site of action is filament coupling sites rather than synapses. Hebbian learning can be summarized as "cells that wire together, fire together" [7]. In our case, filaments (or cells) that are adjoint also provide each other with a learning signal. This learning signal provides the basis for a coordinated, sliding motion. Once a pair of filaments learn each other's movements, their independent phase oscillations become _entrained_ to each other [8]. While this seems to happen as a result of mechanical constraints with the onset of movement generation, we ask a more fundamental question: how does this behavior become organized in the development of a _Bacillaria_ colony?


__Hypothesis 2:__
In addressing Hypothesis #2, we notice that some seemingly neuronal behaviors are generated by actin filaments and their interaction with other components of the colonial cellular matrix. The question might be asked: is the synchronization of movements across filaments (cells) in the colony simply the result of mechanical interactions, or is there a greater degree of autonomous behavior at work? Therefore, we will develop a criterion similar to the Turing test for distinguishing neuronal-generated from non-neuronal-generated behavior. This is similar, at least in principle, to the dilemma of simulated vs. real life-like behavior. In Witkowski and Sinapayen [9], contestants used methods to distinguish between movement trajectories from living organisms (Sharks, Ants, Spiders, and Jaguars) and non-living agents (Boids, Robot Arms, and Artificial Chemical Compounds).

### Distinguishing the role of brains in behavioral autonomy
Table 1 demonstrates how autonomy can be partitioned into real and simulated components.
