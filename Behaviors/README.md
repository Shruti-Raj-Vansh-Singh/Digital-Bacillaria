Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) generate oscillations from a small neural circuit (pacemaker neurons).  

In _Bacillaria_, we observe collective pattern generators (CoPGs?), which are generated from collective and coordinated behavior. No central nervous system or brain is involved.  

_Bacillaria_ brain looks like the following:

* no spatial representation (free-moving), but does exhibit limited goal-directed behavior.

* movement as the seat of intelligence, as suggested in particular Michael Graziano's "Intelligent Movement Machine".

* produces a set of sine waves, one for each pair of filaments.

* the entire chain produces an oscillator with harmonics (delayed by _n_ degrees out-of-phase).  

* potentially we may see spindles at the extremes of each cycle.

Each pair of filamentous cells act as an oscillatory unit in a CoPG. Oscillatory units overlap, so that a colony of 7 filaments consist of 6 oscillatory units. While they generally produce a sine wave, they can also stretch to a maximal value and stay there for long periods of time.

* modeling modes of movement behavior from microscopy data.
