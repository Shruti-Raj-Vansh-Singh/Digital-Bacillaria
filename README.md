_Bacillaria_ is a diatom genus in the [Bacillariaceae family](http://tolweb.org/Bacillariaceae/125684).

## Species
We are working with images primarily from these two species:  

1. _Bacillaria paradoxa_ (Gmelin, 1788)  

2. _Bacillaria paxillifer_ (Hendey, 1951)

## Description of Bacillaria
Cells are elongated and motile, sliding along each other, in stacked colonies. Cells are rectangular in girdle view (when in colonies), and lanceolate in valve view. Raphe system is slightly keeled and runs from pole to pole. Two large plate-like chloroplasts are present, one near each end of the cell. The nucleus is located centrally. Cells are yellow-brown in colour. Fibulae are strong, and the valve surface is covered in transverse parallel structures called striae.

## Our Goal
The deliverable here would be to use machine learning techniques to segment the cells in these movies, and establish their movement between movie frames. After that we can create models to define motility of Bacillaria.
